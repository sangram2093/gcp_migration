Here’s a clean recipe to build the CLI (extensions/cli) without pulling in binaries:

Prep the SDK dependency (from repo root)
cd packages/dbsaicle-sdk/typescript/api
npm install
npm run build (generates api/dist)
Build the SDK bundle (still under packages/dbsaicle-sdk/typescript)
cd ..
If you have bash: npm run build (runs build.sh, tsc + copies api/dist into dist/api/dist)
If not, do the equivalent:
npm install
npx tsc
mkdir -p dist/api/dist
cp -r api/dist/* dist/api/dist/
cp api/package.json dist/api/
Build the CLI itself
cd ../../extensions/cli
npm install --install-links=false
npm run build (runs validate + esbuild bundle; outputs dist/index.js and launcher dist/cn.js)
Run the CLI locally
From extensions/cli: node dist/cn.js (or node dist/index.js)
Notes:

The package version is already 0.0.1.
You may see Node engine warnings if your Node < 20.19; they’re expected and non-blocking for the build.
