Outcomes modeled probabilistically (Section 4: Data and Measurements)

Time‑to‑remediate (TTR), backlog count, rework rate, and optional cycle time are treated as random variables rather than fixed values.
These are the “y” variables the Bayesian model explains.
Treatment variables define tool usage (Section 4.2)

oss_usage_it, vera_usage_it, and their interaction are the treatment signals.
This makes tool usage the causal driver the model is trying to infer.
Hierarchical Bayesian structure (Section 5.1)

Log‑normal model for TTR:
log(TTR_it) ~ Normal(mu_it, sigma)
mu_it includes team and project random effects, time effects, usage effects, and controls:
mu_it = alpha_team + alpha_proj + delta_t
       + beta_oss * oss_usage_it
       + beta_vera * vera_usage_it
       + beta_int * (oss_usage_it * vera_usage_it)
       + gamma * X_it
Backlog is modeled with a Negative Binomial:
backlog_it ~ NegBin(lambda_it, phi)
log(lambda_it) = ...
Priors encode weak assumptions (Section 5.2)

Tool effect coefficients (beta_*) have Normal(0, 0.5) priors after standardization.
Team/project random effects are hierarchical with HalfNormal priors for variance.
This expresses “tools might help or hurt, but large effects are less likely.”
Posterior inference for decision‑grade results (Section 6)

The paper uses Bayesian posterior probabilities, not just p‑values:
P(beta_oss < 0) and P(beta_vera < 0) are the probabilities that the tools reduce TTR.
Credible intervals (not confidence intervals) quantify uncertainty.
ROI is derived from posterior samples (Section 7.4)

ROI is not modeled directly; it’s computed by propagating posterior samples into a cost‑savings formula:
ROI = (time_saved * cost_per_hour - tool_cost) / tool_cost
This yields a distribution of ROI (shown as a density plot).
Sample posterior plots (Section 8)

Two figures illustrate posterior densities of tool effect sizes and ROI distributions.
These are placeholders, but structurally they represent the Bayesian posterior.
If you want, I can add a short “Bayesian Model Summary” box to the paper or annotate the equations so it’s easier for non‑statisticians to follow.
