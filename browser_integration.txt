Summary
Adds in‑chat browser integration powered by a new browser_action tool and a VS Code webview, enabling the assistant to open a URL, interact (click/type/scroll), and return screenshots + console logs inline in the chat. This is a screenshot‑driven preview (no live iframe). Branch browser-integration, tag v0.0.32.

Motivation
Verify generated web apps (e.g., Flask) without leaving the chat.
Provide step‑by‑step, tool‑driven browser interactions with observable outcomes (screenshots/logs).
Maintain security posture: no raw iframe rendering; all content is captured via Puppeteer.
How It Works
The assistant uses browser_action:
launch (URL) → start a browser session at a URL
click (coordinate), type (text), scroll_down, scroll_up, close
Each non‑close action returns a screenshot + console logs, rendered inline in the chat.
The session ends with close, after which other tools can be used again.
Changes

extensions/vscode/src/browser/BrowserPanel.ts: NEW — webview panel that renders the session (URL bar, screenshot area, logs)
extensions/vscode/src/browser/index.ts: NEW — exports/bootstrapping
extensions/vscode/src/extension/VsCodeExtension.ts: wire up panel/commands
extensions/vscode/package.json, package-lock.json: contributions, activation events, deps
UI/UX Notes
Renders an inline “browser session” section with a URL bar, screenshot area, cursor overlay, and console logs.
Not a live iframe; each interaction produces a fresh screenshot/logs for deterministic review.
Configuration
No mandatory settings. Defaults allow launching a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:5000) and interacting.
Testing
Start a local dev server (e.g., Flask).
Ask the assistant to:
Run the server (execute_command).
Use browser_action to launch the local URL.
Perform click/type/scroll_*, then close.
Verify screenshots and console logs appear inline and progress through steps correctly.
Backwards Compatibility
No breaking changes to existing tools or extension flows.
New tool is additive and only used when invoked.
Risks & Mitigations
Long‑running pages or heavy JS can delay screenshots.
Mitigation: Timeouts and load‑state checks; user can close and retry.
Mis‑clicks due to coordinate selection.
Mitigation: Clear screenshots and cursor overlay to guide subsequent clicks.
