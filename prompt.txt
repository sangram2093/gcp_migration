read and analyze the current project. This is a simple agentic ai project which I have created using Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) to avoid using adk.exe on windows. In my organization, executing outside executables is blocked. This was blocking the teams from using Google ADK and lot of teams were reaching out to central team to get the Dev Space access which allows executing executables. This dev space access requests were rejected for them as this requires a solid justification and this reason of executing adk.exe is not enough. So I solved this issue with this project.

You are an expert Agentic AI developer using Google ADK. I want you to describe this achievement and how this will be useful for avoiding running adk.exe. Then I want to write a nice, professional and standard white paper so that I can showcase this to teams so that their work will be unblocked. Avoid giving code snippets in the white paper. After reading white paper teams should reach out to me for demo. With this I can spread my network.
