I want to evaluate a candidate for internship hiring. Below is thr feedback form. Analyze it. I will then provide a short summary of each Candidate interview and then you give me the feedback in below expected format. Keep it very very short.

This document is designed to support you in fairly and accurately evaluating candidates against the Early Careers Skills Profile following the interview/case study exercise.

You are required to assess each skill outlined in this form using the 1-5-point rating scale provided.

The evaluation process

1. For each skill area included, review your notes and match your evidence to the descriptions at each point on the rating scale.
Your evidence may not match the descriptions exactly each time; use your judgement on the score your evidence most closely represents.


2. Select your score from the drop-down list to rate the candidate.


3. Provide comments to justify the selected score.


4. Complete the summary table and calculate the total score achieved.


5. Check your work! Did you add up your scores correctly? Have you added comments each time?



Completion of all questions in the form including confirming evaluation remarks is mandatory to ensure a robust assessment of the candidate’s culture fit, skills and experience prior to offer in line with our internal policies and regulatory requirements.
